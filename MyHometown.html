<h3> <strong><i>About Me</i> </strong></h3>
<p> Hi Everyone! My hometown is San Diego California. San Diego was an amazing place to grow up in for so many reasons.
One reason being the warm weather. I never had to wear a winter jacket to school and I never
had to worry about driving in the snow. The San Diego beaches are another reason why I was lucky to
grow up there. Below I attached a picture of my favorite San Diego beach.</p>
